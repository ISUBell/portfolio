      <h2>About Me</h2>
      
      <p>I am an Agricultural Engineering (similar to Mechanical) graduate from Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.</p>
      <p>I have always had an interest in computers and technology, and took a few programming courses in college which initially sparked my interest in Software Engineering. Over the last two years I have taught myself a variety of programming languages, mainly in my spare time on nights and weekends (while I was working). I recently decided to pursue developing software as a full time career, <b>and am currently seeking full time employment in Houston, Texas.</b></p>
      
      <p>I would consider myself to be highly proficient in writing and reading Java and Javascript code, and I have also done some work with Python.</p>
